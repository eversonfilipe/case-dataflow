<p>A pipeline generally refers to a sequence of stages where data, materials, or tasks are passed through <br>
   various processing steps to achieve a final output. The term is used across various fields, each with a <br>
   slightly different meaning based on the context</p>

<p>A pipeline is designed to handle tasks in a structured, linear progression, ensuring smooth transitions <br>
   between steps. Each stage focuses on a specific action, transforming the input before passing it on to the <br>
   next stage. The goal is efficiency, reducing manual intervention and errors by automating or systematically <br>
   guiding the flow from start to finish. Pipelines help break complex processes into manageable segments, making <br>
   it easier to monitor, optimize, and scale operations. The concept is widely applicable, wherever a process requires <br>
   multiple steps to reach an outcome.</p>
